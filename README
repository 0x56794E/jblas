jblas is a matrix library for Java which uses existing high
performance BLAS and LAPACK libraries like ATLAS.

Version 0.1, March 28, 2009
Version 0.2, May 7, 2009

INSTALL

In principle, all you need is the jblas.jar in your
classpath. jblas.jar will then automagically extract your platform
dependent native library to a tempfile and load it from there. You can
also put that file somewhere in your load path ($LD_LIBRARY_PATH for
Linux, %PATH for Windows).


BUILDING

If you want to build jBLAS from the sources, you need to set up quite
a few things:

You will need some implementation of blas and lapack, for example, as
provided by ATLAS (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/). You also need
the Fortran sources for BLAS and LAPACK, available, for example from
http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack-lite-3.1.1.tgz.

Besides that, you need an installation of ruby, for some code
generation scripts.

If you still want to build the source your own, see INSTALL for further
details.

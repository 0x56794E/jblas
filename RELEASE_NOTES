Release v0.2 - May 8, 2009

Release v0.2 mostly adds features to the build process and renames some
packages and classes to make the structure simpler. No new significant
functionality has been added.

Changes from version v0.1:

- fixed a bug in DoubleMatrix.copy()
- Renamed packages to make structure simpler

  org.jblas.la -> org.jblas
  org.jblas.la.exceptions -> org.jblas.exceptions
  org.jblas.la.ranges -> org.jblas.ranges
  org.jblas.core -> moved content to org.jblas and org.jblas.util

- Renamed classes

  Blas -> NativeBlas

- Build process can now generate different kinds of jar files, and also
  generate shared libraries which are statically linked against BLAS,
  LAPACK or ATLAS. You can also generate a multiplatform jar file which
  contains shared libraries for different platforms.

- Generated wrapper code has been optimized a bit:

  - in the lapack wrapper with automatic workspace allocation, only
    small dummy arrays are passed in the workspace query, meaning that
    the real arrays are only passed once, not twice.

  - The wrapper now also parses information whether output variables
    are input or output and releases the arrays with JNI_ABORT in case
    they are not output variables. This should also reduce the amount
    of copying.

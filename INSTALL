INSTALL

jBLAS depends on a BLAS and LAPACK library for most of its
computational intensive parts. I recommend getting a high-quality
implementation like ATLAS http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/, but
taking the default implementation should also suffice.

For building the stubs, jBLAS also requires the Fortran sources for
the BLAS and LAPACK functions. These can be found for example, from
http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack-lite-3.1.1.tgz.


COMPILING LAPACK/BLAS

1. Copy a matching make.inc.* from the INSTALL directory to the base
   directory
2. In make.inc, add the option "-fPIC" to OPTS and NOOPTS
2. Run "make blaslib lapacklib"
4. For Linux: move "blas_LINUX.a" to "libblas-fortran.a" and 
   "lapack_LINUX.a" to "liblapack-fortran.a"

COMPILING ATLAS (after version 3.8.0)

1. Create a build directory with "mkdir build" and cd into it with "cd build".
2. Run "../configure -Fa alg -fPIC"
3. Run "make" (takes a lot of time, your machine should also not be 
   under load)
4. Change directory to "lib" and run "make shared"

COMPILING JBLAS

1. Set ATLAS_HOME to your atlas directory.
2. Running "ant" should do the job ;)

INSTALLING JBLAS

1. Add jBLAS.jar to your CLASSPATH
2. Make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains libjBLASarray.so and the other 
   shared libraries from ATLAS
